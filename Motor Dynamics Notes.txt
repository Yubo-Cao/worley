# Mr. Goli's Lesson on Motor Dynamics

The relationship between torque and rpm is inverse

Free speed is when there is no load

When you put more load, it puts more torque and draws an excessive amount of power until you reach the stall torque

If you want to get more torque out of a motor to gear heavy things, you have to gear it down (that's where gear boxes come in)

Gear boxes allow you to get more torque out of a motor while decreasing the rpm you get out of it

A motor curve swhows you the amount of power consumed at the rpm its spinning at 
The apex of the graph is where yoiou'll get the maximum output: you want to aim for that all the time

You want to get as many motors of higher wattage as you can to do something, since you could be handling beefy equipment

Torque = force x radius
The more power you have, the more force you can exert for a smaller area. (or rather, torque)
Let's assume that our motor here is the driving force and assume that we have a mass that ius like 25 pounds. 

Just multiply the normal force times the idstance to get the torque! 

You can always combine multiple motors with a gearbox.

Stat rby trying to find the torque numbers on the motor (You want double the amount the stall load)

There's a page that has a table with all the values you need a and a little curve
