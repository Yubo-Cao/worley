Throughout the last Saturday \& Sunday, we have been working on a presentation for the project pitch, computer-aided design (CAD) of the model, \& the preliminary testing of the servo motion. Research on existing solutions of speech recognition, speaker diarization (SD), voice activation detection (VAD), \& speech-to-text (STT) has also been conducted. However, After the meeting with Mr.~Kai, we have decided to focus on the implementation of robotic finger and hand, creating the backlog \& minimum viable product list (MVP), and following an incremental goal to assure the project's success in the end.
