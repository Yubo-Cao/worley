\part{Brainstorming}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A robotic hand that can act out \gls{asl} can be used for someone who relies on \gls{asl} as their primary communication language to be able to communicate independently, without relying on another person to interpret.
    \item The idea is further extended to a robotic arm that can act out \gls{asl}, which can be used to teach \gls{asl} to people who are interested in learning it.
    \item Finally, more research made us realize \gls{asl} is a language on its own, and it is not a direct translation of English. Therefore, we decided to make a robotic arm that can act out \gls{asl}, and also translate English to \gls{asl} using a BERT model.
