\part{Brainstorming}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A robotic hand that can act out American Sign Language (ASL) can be used for someone who relies on ASL as their primary communication language to be able to communicate independently, without relying on another person to interpret.
    \item The idea is further extended to a robotic arm that can act out ASL, which can be used to teach ASL to people who are interested in learning it.
    \item Finally, more research made us realize ASL is a language on its own, and it is not a direct translation of English. Therefore, we decided to make a robotic arm that can act out ASL, and also translate English to ASL using a BERT model.
\end{itemize}
